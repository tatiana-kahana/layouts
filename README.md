# Layouts
This is vanilla HTML/CSS project, responsive for all types of devises. 
View on [layouts.surge.sh/index.html](http://layouts.surge.sh/index.html)
I used advansed CSS technologies such as :
 - Calc()
 - CSS- custom properties and variables
 - flex-box grid system
I made my custom "bootstrap"-like layout, where I wasn't limited in 12 columns only.
Created 4 types of pages, including page with resposive table.
